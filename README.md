# Stock Analysis Tool Developement
Developing a stock analysis tool using Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) in Excel.
## Overview of Project
A good friend of mine, Steve, recently graduated with his finance degree and his proud parents have become his first clients.  His parents are passionate about green energy, so they have invested all their funds in DAQO (DQ).  Steve, keeping his parent's best interests first, wants to perform an analysis on DQ, as well as looking at several other green energy stocks to assure that their portfolio is well diversified.  He has fairly good handle on Excel and its functionality, but is asking for assistance in completing his stock analysis to assure accuracy and efficiency.  Steve will learn of the power and functionality of VBA, which in turn ultimately helps him accurately and efficiently analyze not only a small porfolio, but the entire stock market.

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to macro-enable the Excel workbook so that VBA can be used to develop a tool that will accurately and efficiently analyze stocks.  Initially, an analysis was performed on DQ determining the stock's total daily volume and return for 2018.  Then an analyis of 11 additional green stocks was completed to find those with the best returns.  But the original code did not appear to be the most efficient code.  The original code was *refactored* with the idea of taking fewer steps, using less memory, and improving logic so the analysis would be more efficient.  The outcome of this project looks to determine if the *refactored code* is more efficient than the original code.
